# Weather Website

## Background

Using the data from the Weather Repo I created a dashboard showing off the analysis I've done.

In building this dashboard, individual pages host each comparison plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
